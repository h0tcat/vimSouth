[403 Southern Cross]


Southern Cross!

You are standing here as true as you were born on this earth.

Don't pin all your hopes and dreams on somebody else's lives.


The Southern Cross is twinkling and watching us.

Fat beyond . so far away from us.

Southern Cross is a holy light.

We are the cursaders of the Southern Cross.

Go, if you come up against a hurdle.

Fight, fight for the things you believe in.

Pession, Joy, Sorrow, pain and tears.

All the will be pabulum of your life.

Go, if you come under the wet yourself.

Fight,fight for the person you believe in.

Destiny is calling you...

"Obey me, or defy me"

[PianoSolo : 403]

[PianoSolo & GuiterSolo : 403]

is there a thing whitch is superior to love in this world?

A man is living with loving someone and then being loved by others.

We are standing here as true as we were born on this earth.

The moment of yesterday when we lived is never waste.

The Southern Cross is twinkling and watching us.

Fat beyond . so far away from us.

Southern Cross is a holy light.

We are the cursaders of the Southern Cross.

Go, if you come up against a hurdle.

Fight, fight for the things you believe in.

Pession, Joy, Sorrow, pain and tears.

All the will be pabulum of your life.

Go, if you come under the wet yourself.

Fight,fight for the person you believe in.

Destiny is calling you...

"Obey me, or defy me"
